### Community Manager
TBD

### Senior Moderator
Typically, there will only be one or two Senior Moderator's on our team at one time, this is because Senior Moderators act as the "leader" of our Moderation teams. You will find that a Senior Moderator is usually over the age of 15 as they have many responsibilities, and the role is usually obtained from being a loyal Moderator worthy of the promotion.

A Senior Moderator's main responsibilities include:

Leading the Moderation Team
A Senior Moderator acts as the "leader" of the entire Moderation Team, and therefore it is quite a big responsibility. They should be a good role model to represent the role of a Moderator.

Supervising their Team's actions
A Senior Moderator should keep watch of their team's action and ensure that they never abuse their power or use it wrongly. They are responsible for reporting a Moderator to the Owner, should they use their role to their advantage.

Communicating with Moderators
Being a Senior Moderator, as a leader, means having good communication skills, therefore they can ensure that the Moderation Team is working efficiently and are carrying out their duties correctly.

Making wise decisions
Should the Moderation Team be in a situation where they need the final word on what punishment to carry out on a known culprit (for example: if they're repetitively breaking the rules), they should get the Senior Moderator involved and from there, allow them to deal with the case. 

Communicating with the Owner
A Senior Moderator should be able to communicate with the Owner, as well as work closely with them to make AloraMC a better place to be.

The responsibilities of a Senior Moderator can be quite extensive, and is dependent on how they work, what they're skilled at and how they're able to help AloraMC in many aspects other than Moderation.

### Moderator
The Moderators, whilst inheriting the Junior Moderator's responsibilities, are responsible for ensuring all players are following the rules, and keeping AloraMC a safe environment for everybody. Moderators will typically be aged 14 and over (exceptions apply) and act as the higher ups to Junior Moderators. 

A Moderator's main responsibilities include: 

Keeping chats safe and moderated
Moderators have the plethora of tools from the LiteBans plugin at their fingertips to keep our chats moderated and safe, as well as the game. Moderators may kick, mute, warn and (ip)ban. Moderators also have these permissions in Discord. The Moderators should also remind players of our Code of Conduct, should they need a reminder.

Banning any Cheaters or Hackers
Moderators, should they spot a player who either is using cheats, or is suspected of doing so, should instantly IP-ban them.

Knowledge of our Code of Conduct + Rules
Moderators should be knowledgeable on our Code of Conduct and our Rules. We aren't asking for Moderators to know them both as if they're on the back of their hand, but being knowledgeable on these is important when punishing a player that is confused at their actions and the consequences of such.

Keeping in check with Support Tickets
Moderators should keep in check with any open(ed) tickets on our Support server, including appeals, reports, or anything of that nature. Tickets enquiring about bugs or anything admin-related may be left to Admin's to deal with.

Supporting our Junior Moderators
Of course, we're all a team. Moderators should make sure that Junior Moderators are comfortable with what they're responsible for and should be open to help them if they need it.

### Ambassador
The AloraMC Ambassadors are responsible for engaging in the community, helping out players where they can, keeping our chats relevant and safe from nuisances, and helping out the Mod team as well as being the Community Manager's little helpers! In essence, an AloraMC Ambassador represents our community and should present themselves as a role model.

The role of AloraMC Ambassador is great for those that are active on the server and are a key member of the community but aren't interested in taking on a more serious staff role. The Ambassador's job is a more laid-back and behind-the-scenes kinda thing.

An Ambassador's main responsibilities include: 

Maintaining activity in chat
Our AloraMC Ambassadors are there to keep chat's activity and keep our community engaged in a healthy way, which encourages the concept of AloraMC being a safe environment. 

Analysing trends in the community
Our AloraMC Ambassadors are to be keeping an eye on the community and how their needs are changing. What new things are they wanting on the server? Is there an issue with the server? This is  when the Ambassadors should report to the Community Manager(s) and make sure they're in the know too!

Assisting players
Our AloraMC Ambassadors should also help players out, should they need it, as well as answer questions about AloraMC, such as "How do I join the server?" or "What is the IP?"; just generally being helpful to our community!

Keeping chats safe and moderated
AloraMC Ambassadors have the ability to kick and temporarily mute players (within both Discord & LiteBans). They should do this when arguments are occurring in chat channels, to keep it from escalating. The AloraMC Ambassadors should be there to remind people of our Code of Conduct, should they break it.

Reporting to Moderators
Should a situation escalate to a certain degree, AloraMC Ambassadors should report the situation to their higher ups, the Moderators, to ensure that players involved are dealt with appropriately.

In terms of Support Tickets, AloraMC Ambassadors do have the ability to chat in tickets however they should (more or less) be left to a Moderator or Senior Moderator to handle.

These explanations will be improved as the server continues. Any suggestions, give us a shout!
