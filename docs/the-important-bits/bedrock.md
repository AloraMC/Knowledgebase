# ü§ù Playing on Bedrock

At AloraMC, we believe that everybody should feel welcomed and be able to freely access the services and experiences that we provide. Part of this belief, comes making sure that Bedrock players can enjoy our network in the same way our Java players can.

Unfortunately, it isn't as easy to pimp out our network on Bedrock as it is on Java, so we warn Bedrock players that you may have a **slightly altered** experience when playing on AloraMC. This especially applies when considering custom glyphs and assets within our network. For example, in our Hub, you may notice that the holograms before each gamemode portal look slightly different on each platform. This is because of the limitations Bedrock has, and unfortunately, there is nothing us at AloraMC can do about it. It is at the discretion of Mojang to bring Bedrock to parity with Java in future updates.

## ‚ùì How about my Cosmetics and things I purchase within AloraMC?
You bring up a very important question. We will ensure that if you are a Bedrock player that makes a purchase for something in AloraMC, that it appears a similar way to how it does in Java. All of the items you purchase on AloraMC will be usable and functional no matter what platform you are playing on. **If in the rare case that it is NOT**, then we will ensure that we disclose this within the store before purchasing the item.

-# We are sorry for any inconvenience caused because of this.
