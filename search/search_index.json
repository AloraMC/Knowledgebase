Moderators may kick, mute, warn and (ip)ban. Moderators also have these permissions in Discord. The Moderators should also remind players of our Code of Conduct, should they need a reminder.</p> <p>Banning any Cheaters or Hackers Moderators, should they spot a player who either is using cheats, or is suspected of doing so, should instantly IP-ban them.</p> <p>Knowledge of our Code of Conduct + Rules Moderators should be knowledgeable on our Code of Conduct and our Rules. We aren't asking for Moderators to know them both as if they're on the back of their hand, but being knowledgeable on these is important when punishing a player that is confused at their actions and the consequences of such.</p> <p>Keeping in check with Support Tickets Moderators should keep in check with any open(ed) tickets on our Support server, including appeals, reports, or anything of that nature. Tickets enquiring about bugs or anything admin-related may be left to Admin's to deal with.</p> <p>Supporting our Junior Moderators Of course, we're all a team.

They should do this when arguments are occurring in chat channels, to keep it from escalating. The AloraMC Ambassadors should be there to remind people of our Code of Conduct, should they break it.</p> <p>Reporting to Moderators Should a situation escalate to a certain degree, AloraMC Ambassadors should report the situation to their higher ups, the Moderators, to ensure that players involved are dealt with appropriately.</p> <p>In terms of Support Tickets, AloraMC Ambassadors do have the ability to chat in tickets however they should (more or less) be left to a Moderator or Senior Moderator to handle.</p> <p>These explanations will be improved as the server continues.
